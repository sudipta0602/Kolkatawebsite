    The Indian Botanic Garden previously known as Royal Botanic Garden with the famous Banyan tree is comprised of 285.05 acres of land is about 1000 bighas and lies on the bank of the River Hooghly just outside the Municipal area of Howrah bordering its southern boundary line and adjoins the compound of the Shibpur Engineering College (Now known as Indian Institute of Engineering, Science & Technology) on the south.
    This green belt is considered to be the lungs of the highly industrial and urbanized city of Howrah. Use of plastic materials has been banned in the Garden Campus.
    In the Garden, beside the great banyan tree we have a fair collection of rare indigenous and exotic plants, beautiful Amazon lilies, climbing plants, varieties of palm, delicate orchids and all sorts of large trees – mahogany, teak, walnut etc. We also find here a nursery (not open to the public), a Conservatory, a palm House, a Herbarium, an Orchid conservatory. We have also a second large Banyan tree. Besides we can find in the Garden the following Monuments and buildings:- Wallich’s Monument, Kyds’ Monuments, Griffiths Monument, Jack’s Monument, Kurze’s Monument, Roxburg’s monument, Palmyra Bridge, Superintendent’s Office, Curator’s Office, Ladies Cloak Room, Gentelmen’s Cloak Room, Residence of Assistant Curator, Residence of Curator of Herbarium, a large Pavilion, a small Pavilion.

  <h2>The great banayan tree</h2>

  <p>
      The Great Banyan Tree (GBT) is an outstanding living legend of the AJC Bose Indian Botanic Garden and it acts as an Iconic structure of the garden.  It is one of the star attractions not only for Indian visitors but also for foreign delegates.  GBT finds mention in “Guinness Book of World Records” for its massive canopy.  Famous among the local public by the names like ‘Walking’ and ‘Immortal’ tree, it is certainly one of the largest living entities in the World. In comparison with garden exhibits of exotic plants like bamboos, palms, cacti & succulents etc., GBT draws maximum visitors throughout the year.  Botanically known as Ficus benghalensis L.  belonging to the family Moraceae, the tree is a native of India. The fruit is a small fig, red in colour when ripe and it is not edible. It is over 270 years old and in terms of area of spread known to be the largest tree.  There is no clear history of the tree as to the time of planting etc. But it is mentioned in the travel books of the nineteenth century as existing on a Phoenix tree (date palm), when Col. Robert Kyd initiated this garden in the year 1787.  GBT was damaged by two great cyclones of 1864 and 1867 during which, some of its main branches got damaged exposing it to the attack of a hard fungus.  In 1925, it main trunk measuring 16 m in girth had to be removed after it was infected by wood rotting fungus.  With its large number of aerial roots which drops from its branches and runs vertically to the ground and look like so many trunks, the GBT appears more like a miniature forest than an individual tree. Thus, as the branches grow longer horizontally, they are not only supported by a series of pillar like prop roots but are also provided with nourishment.  These aerial roots are initially passed through the bamboo channels and hastened by care and trained to take a particular position in the ground finally providing maximum support to the growing horizontal branches.  It is interesting to note that, despite the absence of main trunk, the tree still maintains perfect vigor and vitality. Present area occupied by the tree is about 18918 sq. m.  The present crown of the tree has a circumference of 486 m. and the highest branch rises to 24.5m. The total number of aerial roots as on date is 4033 reaching down to the ground as prop roots. Thus, GBT is standing tall and as senior most citizen of the garden thereby enhancing the beauty and serenity of the area.
