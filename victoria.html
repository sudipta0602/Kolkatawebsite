        The Victoria Memorial is a large marble building in Central Kolkata, which was built between 1906 and 1921. It is dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria, now a museum under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, and is the largest monument in the world which is dedicated to a royal.[2] The memorial lies on the Maidan and is one of the famous monuments of Kolkata. <br>

            In January 1901, on the death of Queen Victoria,[3] then Lord Curzon, suggested the creation of a fitting memorial. Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.[4]

Curzon said,

"Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past."[5]

The Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.[6]

In 1912, before the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, King George V announced the transfer of the capital of India from Kolkata to New Delhi.[7] Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital.

The Victoria Memorial was mainly funded by British Officials, & individuals of India.[5] The Politicians and people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to one crore, five lakhs of Rupees (₹), was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions.[8]

The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905 with a subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project and the need for testing of the foundations. The Victoria Memorial's foundation stone was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921.[9] The work of construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Kolkata. Work on the superstructure began in 1910. After 1947, some additions were made to the Memorial.

A smaller Victoria memorial was also constructed in the Hardoi District, which has since been converted into a city club for recreation. It is also where Mahatma Gandhi addressed Hardoi in the 1930's. <br>

    The Victoria Memorial's architect was William Emerson (1843–1924).[10][11] The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani architectural influences.[12] The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble.[13]

The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial.
